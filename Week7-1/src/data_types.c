/* This program has declared a variable called 'data'.
   The variable is of type 'int' and has been assigned
   the value of 3. We should get the output of
   'Data: 3' when we run the program.
   
   Things to try:
          - Change the value of 'data'
          - Display the value in hexidecimal (%x)
          - Use another printf statement to display
            another value on the next line
          - Use a single printf to display two values
          - Change the variable type to float
          - Display only 3 decimal places
